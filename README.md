# Info-Board

## Description

Info Board is an external project that I am working on that will allow me, as well as other users to login to their account and view information about themselves. This information includes projects they have worked on, important documents they have created, and other general data. From there they can click to view the information. For example, if they click on a development project they have been working on they will be taken to the github link for that project, or if they click on their CV they will be taken to the Google Docs page that they created it on.
